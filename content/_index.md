## Art and The Artist

The concept of separating art from an artist has become commonplace in the analysis of modern popular culture. As societal standards change, access to information increases, and decentralized platforms provide voices to those often forgotten, the despicable actions of people in power have called the enjoyment of their art into question. How can art from someone terrible be consumed? Should we even derive enjoyment from it?

This conversation dominates much of the contemporary discourse on ethically consuming art, but the idea of outsider art presents a similar argument. The term came into use as a result of the compilation album, "Songs in the Key of Z," curated by Irwin Chusid.

> Yet Outsider Music has its place -- an intimate, dimly lit enclave. Songs in the Key of Z attempts to air out the dusty attics and damp cellars of the greater music community, introducing some of the dizzy aunts and eccentric uncles about whom your parents rarely spoke.

Outsider music can be defined as music created by independent artists that doesn't conform to generally accepted musically standards, in some way. What distinguishes this from experimental, or avant-garde, music is the fact that these artists aren't focused on defying societal norms. The music they create is simply true to them, and they believe that it aligns with other music in the modern canon. The above quote from Chusid hints at the implications of this, but doesn't fully expand on the conditions of these artists.

Many artists who would be funneled into the category of outsider music have severe mental illness, have been subject to domestic abuse, and had their success treated like a freak show. When presented with this context, Chusid's quote itself becomes an ethical artist, subconsciously dismissing the realities of many of these artists. While some artists featured on his compilation are truly, "dizzy aunts and eccentric uncles," there is an air of flippancy to this statement when some of the most popular artists on the tape were known to have faced these adverse conditions.

Since the inception of this concept, many others in the music community have given their insight on the enjoyment of this genre, and this non-traditional view of "separating the art from the artist." This report will analyze the ethical arguments that are made for different artists to further understand the moral implications of enjoyment.

## Wesley Willis: The Intent of Humor

Wesley Willis is a rock and roll artist whose music features his lyrics over keyboard backing tracks. He's notorious for outrageous lyrics about "whupping Batman's ass," how McDonalds is a place for rock-n-roll, and "the chicken cow." When meeting fans he would offer them his signature headbutt which resulted in the consistent bruise in the middle of his forehead. Much of his appeal comes from the questionably intentioned humor in his music. Before his musical career, he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. This muddies the discourse around Willis' work, as enjoyment of his music became an ethical concern.

The video above attempts to highlight all facets of Willis' public appearance, highlighting his irreverent demeanor, bizarre song concepts, and attempts to capitalize on his musical career. The included clips don't include some of his more expletive-laden songs, or portray him in a demeaning light, presenting a very neutral and respecting image of him. The existence of this idealistic portrayal argues that it is morally acceptable to enjoy his music respectfully. It doesn't allow his mental illness to become the spectacle, but as a result, ignores the fact that maybe this shouldn't be acceptable at all, even in a respectful manner.

Some arguments aren't so optimistic. Buddy Seigal argues that the enjoyment of his work could be unethical while simultaneously, perpetrating stereotypes towards those with mental illness:

> The demon that Willis speaks of is a voice in his head he calls “Nervewrecker.” In conversation, the 33-year-old is largely unresponsive to questions, going off into a stream-of-consciousness monologue that can be deeply disturbing and is at times indecipherable. He stutters and sputters, repeating himself endlessly as he delivers non sequiturs like a mad street person; in fact, Willis spent many years homeless, living on the streets of Chicago.

His use of "sputters" dehumanizes Willis, mocking his neurodiverse speech patterns. He also compares him to a "mad street person" and ensures that the audience knows that he was actually homeless as well. It is difficult to analyze language surrounding social issues from the past, as things that are perceived as unacceptable now, could've previously been commonplace. Regardless, this piece was released within a couple of years of the video, and paints him in a negative light before an ethical argument is explicitly presented.

> In trumpeting Willis, they seem to be laughing not so much with him as at him, in a 'let’s hang out with the retard and have a giggle' display of rank insensitivity, mindless pack mentality and rampant egotism. But then, rock musicians have seldom been noted for their keen sense of morality, so it’s perhaps unreasonable to expect them to examine the motives behind their actions.
> The rest of us are left to ask ourselves what all of this really means. Is Willis genuinely better off onstage making a spectacle of himself than he would be left to his own devices? Doesn’t he have the same right as everyone else to earn a living as he sees fit? If performing brings Willis joy and a temporary respite from the torments of 'The Demon,' can his rock ‘n’ roll sideshow be anything but good?

Seigal continues his questionable rhetoric here, as he begins to analyze the ethics of enjoying Willis' art. The piece becomes more snide as he questions the ability of rock musicians to have moral compasses, accusing Willis' band of taking advantage of him. The inclusion of a slur here is, again, tough to analyze out of context, but slightly delegitimizes any argument he's making. Seigal ends the piece with a generic line of questioning that feigns ethical ambiguity, while his point is clearly made through the language of his piece.

Although Seigal undeniably believes that Willis should not be in the position that he is in, it seems to come from a place of malice, rather than a serious consideration of the complications of his mental illness. Regardless, this is an ethical artifact that deserves recognition, as it is reminiscent of the clumsy mental health discourse in Willis' life. It's actually difficult to find a piece from this time period published in a major newspaper that doesn't paint Willis' success or mental illness with disdain.

Stephen Gossett of the Thrillist also considered the morality of enjoying Willis' work with a bit more time to process. The most resolute of these considerations occurs in his description of a Wesley Willis tribute night at a local bar:

> There was little in the way of moral anxiety or fraught spectatorship. Thirteen years of distance helps that, so too does our collectively more nuanced critical capacity -- an embrace of craft and deliberation that complicates narratives of self-taught artists as unstudied, unaware vessels. Looking back on Willis’ prolific full-steam-ahead career, his brilliant appropriation of brand promotion, and his autonomous artistic cogency, you start to feel like he probably reached that breakthrough some quarter century ahead of schedule. Rock on, Wes.

Within the same article Gossett ponders the autonomy of Willis, and whether the fame pushed onto him could've negatively impacted him. That point largely revolves here as he begins to acknowledge that Willis ultimately loved what he did and worked hard to make sure that he could continue doing it. He also contrasts the audience from years ago that requested his music on the radio while casually using slurs, to those today who genuinely appreciate his art.

Similarities from these positive portrayals of Willis undeniably arise. When suggesting that it is ethical to enjoy his work, they revere him instead of demeaning him. This could largely come as a result of the structure of their position, as it would be unreasonable to praise him while suggesting that people shouldn't be allowed to do the same. Willis seems to uniformly make people uncomfortable, independent of ethical arguments, but is an important case to consider.
