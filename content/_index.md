## Art and The Artist

Artists have always existed in fringes of culture. Be it the conspiracy-laden
discussions of "Hollyweird" or the aversion some have towards their local, hair
dye-fueled art scenes, artists are oftentimes objectified and isolated
irrespective of the enjoyment of their work. This concept especially thrived
within the somewhat recently formed world of outsider music. The term came into
use as a result of the compilation album, "Songs in the Key of Z," curated by
Irwin Chusid.

> Yet Outsider Music has its place -- an intimate, dimly lit enclave. Songs in
> the Key of Z attempts to air out the dusty attics and damp cellars of the
> greater music community, introducing some of the dizzy aunts and eccentric
> uncles about whom your parents rarely spoke.

Outsider music can be defined as music created by independent artists that
doesn't conform to generally accepted musically standards, in some way. What
distinguishes this from experimental, or avant-garde, music is the fact that
these artists aren't focused on defying societal norms. The music they create is
simply true to them, and they believe that it aligns with other music in the
modern canon. The above quote from Chusid hints at the implications of this, but
doesn't fully expand on the conditions of these artists.

Many artists who would be funneled into the category of outsider music have
severe mental illness, have been subject to domestic abuse, and had their
success treated like a freak show. When presented with this context, Chusid's
quote itself becomes an ethical artist, subconsciously dismissing the realities
of many of these artists. While some artists featured on his compilation are
truly, "dizzy aunts and eccentric uncles," there is an air of flippancy to this
statement when some of the most popular artists on the tape were known to have
faced these adverse conditions.

Since the inception of this concept, many others in the music community have
given their insight on the enjoyment of this genre, and this non-traditional
view of "separating the art from the artist." This report will analyze the
ethical arguments that are made for different artists to further understand the
moral implications of enjoyment.

## Wesley Willis: The Intent of Humor

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S2uRv8ZE_Tc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Wesley Willis is a rock and roll artist whose music features his lyrics over
keyboard backing tracks. He's notorious for outrageous lyrics about "whupping
Batman's ass," how McDonalds is a place for rock-n-roll, and "the chicken cow."
When meeting fans he would offer them his signature headbutt which resulted in
the consistent bruise in the middle of his forehead. Much of his appeal comes
from the questionably intentioned humor in his music. Before his musical career,
he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. This muddies the discourse around
Willis' work, as enjoyment of his music became an ethical concern.

The video above attempts to highlight all facets of Willis' public appearance,
highlighting his irreverent demeanor, bizarre song concepts, and attempts to
capitalize on his musical career. The included clips don't include some of his
more expletive-laden songs, or portray him in a demeaning light, presenting a
very neutral and respecting image of him. The existence of this idealistic
portrayal argues that it is morally acceptable to enjoy his music respectfully.
It doesn't allow his mental illness to become the spectacle, but as a result,
ignores the fact that maybe this shouldn't be acceptable at all, even in a
respectful manner.

Some arguments aren't so optimistic. Buddy Seigal argues that the enjoyment of
his work could be unethical while simultaneously, perpetrating stereotypes
towards those with mental illness:

> The demon that Willis speaks of is a voice in his head he calls
> “Nervewrecker.” In conversation, the 33-year-old is largely unresponsive to
> questions, going off into a stream-of-consciousness monologue that can be
> deeply disturbing and is at times indecipherable. He stutters and sputters,
> repeating himself endlessly as he delivers non sequiturs like a mad street
> person; in fact, Willis spent many years homeless, living on the streets of
> Chicago.

His use of "sputters" dehumanizes Willis, mocking his neurodiverse speech
patterns. He also compares him to a "mad street person" and ensures that the
audience knows that he was actually homeless as well. It is difficult to analyze
language surrounding social issues from the past, as things that are perceived
as unacceptable now, could've previously been commonplace. Regardless, this
piece was released within a couple of years of the video, and paints him in a
negative light before an ethical argument is explicitly presented.

> In trumpeting Willis, they seem to be laughing not so much with him as at him,
> in a 'let’s hang out with the retard and have a giggle' display of rank
> insensitivity, mindless pack mentality and rampant egotism. But then, rock
> musicians have seldom been noted for their keen sense of morality, so it’s
> perhaps unreasonable to expect them to examine the motives behind their
> actions. The rest of us are left to ask ourselves what all of this really
> means. Is Willis genuinely better off onstage making a spectacle of himself
> than he would be left to his own devices? Doesn’t he have the same right as
> everyone else to earn a living as he sees fit? If performing brings Willis joy
> and a temporary respite from the torments of 'The Demon,' can his rock ‘n’
> roll sideshow be anything but good?

Seigal continues his questionable rhetoric here, as he begins to analyze the
ethics of enjoying Willis' art. The piece becomes more snide as he questions the
ability of rock musicians to have moral compasses, accusing Willis' band of
taking advantage of him. The inclusion of a slur here is, again, tough to
analyze out of context, but slightly delegitimizes any argument he's making.
Seigal ends the piece with a generic line of questioning that feigns ethical
ambiguity, while his point is clearly made through the language of his piece.

Although Seigal undeniably believes that Willis should not be in the position
that he is in, it seems to come from a place of malice, rather than a serious
consideration of the complications of his mental illness. Regardless, this is an
ethical artifact that deserves recognition, as it is reminiscent of the clumsy
mental health discourse in Willis' life. It's actually difficult to find a piece
from this time period published in a major newspaper that doesn't paint Willis'
success or mental illness with disdain.

Stephen Gossett of the Thrillist also considered the morality of enjoying
Willis' work with a bit more time to process. The most resolute of these
considerations occurs in his description of a Wesley Willis tribute night at a
local bar:

> There was little in the way of moral anxiety or fraught spectatorship.
> Thirteen years of distance helps that, so too does our collectively more
> nuanced critical capacity -- an embrace of craft and deliberation that
> complicates narratives of self-taught artists as unstudied, unaware vessels.
> Looking back on Willis’ prolific full-steam-ahead career, his brilliant
> appropriation of brand promotion, and his autonomous artistic cogency, you
> start to feel like he probably reached that breakthrough some quarter century
> ahead of schedule. Rock on, Wes.

Within the same article Gossett ponders the autonomy of Willis, and whether the
fame pushed onto him could've negatively impacted him. That point largely
revolves here as he begins to acknowledge that Willis ultimately loved what he
did and worked hard to make sure that he could continue doing it. He also
contrasts the audience from years ago that requested his music on the radio
while casually using slurs, to those today who genuinely appreciate his art.

Similarities from these positive portrayals of Willis undeniably arise. When
suggesting that it is ethical to enjoy his work, they revere him instead of
demeaning him. This could largely come as a result of the structure of their
position, as it would be unreasonable to praise him while suggesting that people
shouldn't be allowed to do the same. Willis seems to uniformly make people
uncomfortable, independent of ethical arguments, but is an important case to
consider.

## Earnest Pain: Daniel Johnston

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3OvWFurOBk8?start=588" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Daniel Johnston was an Austin-based independent musician, known for his
heartfelt, lofi ballads. He arguably experienced the most fame out of any
Outsider Music artists, as [Kurt Cobain frequently wore a shirt bearing his
art](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/kurt-cobain-daniel-johnston-t-shirt/). Like
Wesley Willis, Daniel Johnston was diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffered
with mental illness throughout his life. At one point, when flying with his
father, he experienced a psychotic episode and threw the keys of the plane [out
of the window](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/crash-landing-1.1038523). His
father was luckily able to land the plane, but the effect that mental illness
had on Johnston's life was crippling and constant.

**Daniel Johnston, Peek a Boo**

> You can listen to these songs
>
> Have a good time and walk away
>
> But for me it’s not that easy
>
> I have to live these songs forever
>
> Please hear my cry for help
>
> And save me from myself

However, the argument about the ethics of enjoying his work is a bit more
nuanced than that of Wesley Willis, as Johnston's is critically beloved.
Johnston has varied compositions, has worked with numerous notable artists and
producers, and is oftentimes considered somewhat on the verge of outsider music.
Does it make it more acceptable to listen to him if the music is more
conventionally enjoyable, and he isn't some spectacle to be laughed at. Instead,
Johnston is often unwillingly perceived as childlike and somewhat ethereal.
David McNamee, from The Guardian, argues that this perception of him is
patronizing, and that he should be considered the same as any other artist.

> I wonder if people go see him hoping to witness a nervous breakdown,"
> Johnston's friend Gretchen Phillips told music historian Irwin Chusid. "Do
> they perceive him as their equal, or as someone they need to coax along and
> feel safe? As much as the audience may genuinely love his songs, I sense a lot
> of condescension. That's always bugged me.

Provided here is the unique perspective of someone close to Johnston who is
cautious about the audience of his music. Through her questioning, she makes it
clear that she isn't making definitive ethical claims, but instead expressing
concern. She also presents an interesting argument on whether the audience views
him as equal. Society has placed drastically different values on artists
throughout time, ranging from the bottom of the social pyramid, to being
worshiped like gods. Here Phillips questions whether Johnston is furthered
distinguished from other musicians, and ultimately argues that if he is, it's
wrong. Artists can often be objectified to solely be considered entertainment
machines, but to simultaneously further diminish artists with mental health
issues would be especially wrong according to Phillips.

Johnston himself echoes this sentiment:

> Throw me a peanut
>
> Laugh and make jokes
>
> But I've had enough peanuts and I'm ready to croak...
>
> You say I'm cute
>
> You don't know how much that hurts
>

By calling to the classic comparison of an artist to a circus animal, Johnston
makes his audience aware of his situation, making it clear that his friend's
opinion did have some reality to it. People with mental illness can often be
seen as having a severe lack of agency, but Johnston makes it blatantly clear
that he is aware of the way that some of his audience members perceive him. He
makes an ethical argument on the enjoyment of his own work, which can become a
bit messy. He obviously has the right to make any claim about his experience and
opinion, but can it be taken as a legitimate ethical artifact for this issue.
This idea is also presented in McNamee's article:

> It's often assumed that Johnston's music comes directly as a result of his
> well-documented psychological problems (an extreme, delusion-feeding form of
> bipolar disorder). This isn't true. Yes, his bipolar disorder – now under
> control – has impacted on his music, but not in the way most people assume.
> Johnston lacks the filters used by other songwriters to screen lines that may
> be inappropriate, resulting in an obsessive repetition of his core themes: the
> redemptive power of love, unrequited love, a girl called Laurie. But due to
> the medication he needed to control his mania, Johnston was never even able to
> write or play music while imbalanced. His records don't sound scrawled and
> scratchy because he's mentally ill; they sound like that because they were
> often just recorded in a basement, on a boombox, with a broken chord organ and
> Speak & Spell for accompaniment.

Here, McNamee attempts to disregard the perception of the tortured artist
existing within Johnston. Although he is not directly arguing for or against the
ethics of enjoying his work in this artifact, he is directly addressing his
agency and skill, making it clear Daniel Johnston really is like any other
artist. By arguing that Johnston and his work are not just a product of his
mental illness, McNamee highlights the legitimacy of him as an artist and the
ability for an audience to enjoy his art. His direct language further highlights
this, even though it might delve into presuming too much, as the author isn't in
any place to claim what the different influences on Johnston's work looked like.
This tone makes it clear that the author is very passionate in defending
Johnston, and ensuring that he is presented in a positive and honest light.

Without even making direct ethical arguments around the enjoyment of his work,
the dialogue around Johnston's agency in his career, make clear arguments about
the morals of enjoying his work. He also presents an interesting case study for
outsider music, as the quality is objectively higher than other artists and
therefore creates an entirely different argument on the merit of enjoying him.

When the members of the Shaggs, three sisters, were in their adolescence, there
father had a vision that they would grow up to be rock stars.
